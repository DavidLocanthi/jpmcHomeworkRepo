Things I know I should do that I didn't:
  1) Interfaces for the services
  2) Remove old imports and test endpoints
  3) Figure out how to write meaningful tests for HttpService layer
  4) Possibly even write tests for the controller
  5) Change some of the model names to avoid confusion
  6) Logic for requests with incorrect providers
  7) Manually write .equals for Response model because Lombok's is order-sensitive
